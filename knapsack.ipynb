    "def add_cover_cuts(model):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Adds cover cuts to the given optimization model based on capacity constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Cover cuts are additional constraints that improve the linear relaxation \n",
    "    of integer programs by tightening the feasible region. This function focuses \n",
    "    on capacity constraints and applies cover inequalities to strengthen the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Parameters:\n",
    "    model (gurobipy.Model): The optimization model (Gurobi model) for which cover cuts\n",
    "                            will be added.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Behavior:\n",
    "    1. The function first solves the given model to obtain an initial solution.\n",
    "    2. It then identifies constraints related to capacity (identified by constraint names \n",
    "       starting with \"capacity_\"). These constraints are linear expressions.\n",
    "    3. For each identified capacity constraint, a new binary variable `z_j` is created for \n",
    "       each variable `x_j` in the constraint. A secondary model (cover model) is built to \n",
    "       determine a minimal cover, which is a subset of variables that violate the capacity \n",
    "       constraint.\n",
    "    4. The cover model is solved to find which variables should be part of the cover. \n",
    "       The cover inequality is added to the original model as a new constraint, ensuring \n",
    "       that the sum of selected variables (`x_j`) does not exceed the size of the cover minus one.\n",
    "    5. After adding the cover cuts, the original model is re-optimized.\n",
